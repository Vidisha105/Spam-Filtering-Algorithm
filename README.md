# Spam-Filtering-Algorithm
In order to help sort out spam emails, I analyzed a set of emails from Kaggle datasets and utilized machine learning concepts like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a neural network model which predicts whether an email is spam or not. The model has an accuracy of 95%, with a 90% precision rate, indicating that it is a good and proven model.   Utilizing a similar model would be very beneficial to small size companies that do not have large cyber security budgets helping them reduce spam. This would save them both time and money as it is a quick and affordable solution that would decrease the amount of spam emails they encounter.

I incorporated multiple datasets from Kaggle to ensure our model took into account a variety of factors. The first dataset is from Apache SpamAssassin’s public dataset. The files “0030228easyham.tar.bz2' and '20030228_spam.tar.bz2” consist of a sample of emails, from with 2,500 are identified are non-spam, and 500 are spam.
The second dataset is obtained from Kaggle, provided by aueb.gr. The folders used are “Enron 1” and “Enron 2” which also contain a sample of emails, split between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. 

The 3rd dataset is also a collection of spam and non-spam emails obtained from Kaggle. These datasets will be combined for analysis. This will help our model understand how to better predict which emails are spam or not.
