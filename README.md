# Spam-Filtering-Algorithm
In order to help sort out spam emails, we analyzed a set of emails from Kaggle datasets and utilized machine learning concepts like Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a neural network model which predicts whether an email is spam or not. The model has an accuracy of 95%, with a 90% precision rate, indicating that it is a good and proven model.   Utilizing a similar model would be very beneficial to small size companies that do not have large cyber security budgets helping them reduce spam. This would save them both time and money as it is a quick and affordable solution that would decrease the amount of spam emails they encounter.
